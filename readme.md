This is the code for my Jupiter Grades tracker that emails people whenever their Jupitergrades updates. I originally wanted to made it usable by everyone, but the server would cost too much and nobody was willing to pay for the service. The code still works though for Python 3.2+

HOW TO USE:


1. Edit the grades.py with your gmail email and password where the comments are (put them in quotes)

2. Edit the gradesRun.py with the personal information of the person you are sending notifications to (Private Jupiter link, course list, email, phone mail (found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_SMS_gateways), and methods of notification


3. You might want to rename the gradesRun.py into something identifying (e.g. gradesArya.py)


4. Run the file and leave it open, the work has been done for you :)

You can run multiple of these at a time, just run different versions of the gradesRun.py with different information


If you're going to use this please let me know. Thank you :)
